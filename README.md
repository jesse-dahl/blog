This is a blog created using HTML/EJS, CSS, and JavaScript for the FrontEnd with NodeJS and later MongoDB for the BackEnd. I am creating this simply to refamiliarize myself with NodeJS and Mongo, so the frontend is not going to be spectacular. I may revisit this down the road and refactor everything using React for the frontend but like i said, I care more about the backend for this project
